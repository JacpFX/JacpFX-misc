Samples Repository for JacpFX and vertx in Java.
------------------------------------------------

### JacpFX, Vert.x, Java 8 Remote Drawing example.
This example uses JacpFX 2.0 RC2. This version should be quite stable and hopefully RC3 will be the last version before release. The user API is final, so you should not expect any changes here.

**How to run the example**
- start two or more ApplicationMain class(es), create or connect to server and draw.
